# Overview of code

- Code is split into differet files
 - main.py file belongs to python
 - base.html, home.html, videos.html, calculator.html, and journals.html belong to html code
### main.py
main.py contained all the code we used for downloading stuff. main.py also contained the code that allowed us to use the naigation bar.
### base.html
This .html file contained all of our baseline code. It had the navigation bar and all the code that would be constant throughout every page.
### home.html
This .html file contained the code for out home page
### videos.html
This .html file contained an image that was also a link to a youtube channel, that would have videos about calculus topics.

# Requirements
- We used Git to share our code with the teacher and everyone else.
- We used IntelliJ to run the code.
- We used Flask and routes to make the website pretty and organized. We also used it to make the actual website.
- We used Bootstrap so that the code would look organzied even if the tab was smaller.
- We used Jinja to write the code in blocks so that we could use the html and make the navigation bar easier to manage.
